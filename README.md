C++ Implementation of Karger's Min Cut Algorithm

This project has two classes and a main driver program to implement Karger's Min Cut Algorithm. The first is a Graph class which represents a 
graph as a vector of Edges. The second is a Weighted Union Find data structure as described in Sedgewick and Wayne. Finally, the 
program is tested on an adjacency list of 200 nodes which are presented in increasing order.
